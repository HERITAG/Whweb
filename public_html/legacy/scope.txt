&geog=Natural heritage sites reflect the entire spectrum of geographical diversity on the planet, including tropical forests and marine reserves; desert expanses and coastal wetlands; island 'laboratories of evolution' and majestic mountain ranges; waterfalls, canyons and bizarre land formations. All are home to myriad wildlife. In 'cultural landscapes', human settlements have shaped and closely integrated with the environment.
&conserv=UNESCO's World Heritage program seeks to build public awareness of the world's cultural and natural heritage, but most importantly, develops and coordinates major conservation projects. Angkor in Cambodia, Petra in Jordan and the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador are but a few examples. World Heritage Web will highlight these and other conservation and preservation efforts.
&travel=Many travelers want to include World Heritage Sites on their itineraries, and our web site will provide basic information for the tourist. The impact of tourism - to fragile ecologies and historical city centers is a great concern to conservators; World Heritage Web will encourage ecologically and culturally sensitive tourism.
&art=World Heritage sites contain art spanning all of history, from the earliest rock art to medieval frescoes to modern works on the walls of major museums. Visitors to World Heritage Web will be able to explore this great variety in an entertaining fashion.
&ecol=Many of the natural heritage sites are national parks and nature reserves, where the line has been drawn to preserve fragile ecosystems, and where focused study of organisms and their environment takes place.
&history=All the major civilizations are represented in the 788 World Heritage sites - by the long vacant ruins and by the still-vital city centers which have played host to many successive societies. A major goal of World Heritage Web is to allow visitors to step through historical eras easily, gaining new conceptual understanding while being entertained.
&relig=The major religions are all represented in the World Heritage List: Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity and Islam. There are also a number of sites sacred to practitioners of early animist and polytheistic traditions.
&archae=Perhaps what people think of first upon hearing "world heritage sites" are the spectacular remnants of great past societies: Angkor and the Pyramids; Pompeii and Machu Pichhu. These and many lesser known places are sites of significant archaeological work - past and ongoing. Several of the most significant early-man sites are listed as well, where we met Lucy, Java Man and Peking Man.
&anthro=World Heritage sites are the physical record of human societies and endeavors - in all their diversity, over time. World Heritage Web will document these in innovative ways, revealing threads and connections and providing context for understanding.
&archit=One of the principal ways mankind shapes the environment is building. The World Heritage List comprises every conceivable type of architecture, from cliff dwellings and rock-hewn temples to massive cathedrals and mosques to whimsical celebrations, the modern and the post-modern.
